# videobrainz-concepts
The purpose of this repository is to facilitate the development of VideoBrainz concepts in the initial period of VideoBrainz emergence as a MetaBrainz project.  At some point as the concepts mature there will be new repositories created and this project may very well go away.

## Organization
The video-brainz repository has a very simple organization consisting of a small set of topical directories used to hold related items.  At present, two directories (topic areas) exist:

- `use_cases` - where we attempt to describe all the various ways VideoBrainz may be used.
- `ontology` - where we attempt to define our terms, entities, and relationships in the VideoBrainz domain
